    <h2>Turn Down These Voices</h2>
    <h4>This poem was inspired by Soul</h4>
    <p class="poem">

    <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
    <p>One of my interest growing up in Fresno, California was Hip Hop.
        <br>It was a part of our culture and a huge piece of my childhood.
        <br>I remember listen to artists like Eminem, Tupac, and Chamillionaire,
        <br>with my friends and it's a big part of who I am.

    </p>
    <p>Another interest of mine is Photography and Videography.
        <br>I love Capturing random moment in my families lives. Its fun
        <br>creating fun music video with the videos and photos I capture.
        <br>My interest even took me as far as getting to do a photo shoot
        <br>for my friends Wedding this summer.
    </p>
    <p>My last but not lease interest is Coding.
        <br>The Software Engineering journey has been fun.
        <br>I like to learn new languages and finding fun
        <br>thing to create, just like this very webpage.
        <br>I am also currently a work study employee at UVU's
        <br>DX department and I am gaining a ton of experience.
        <br>It gets me excited to see what the future holds.
